				<h1>Excellence in Academics Tutoring’s<br>Mission Statement</h1>
				<p>To assist students in excelling in their academic world, and to be an ally to the parent in seeing their students succeed academically and civically.</p>
				<h1>About Excellence in Academics Tutoring, LLC.</h1>
				<div class="img"><img src="images/desk.jpg" width="200" height="267"></div>
				<p>Excellence in Academics Tutoring, LLC. (EAT) was founded and is owned by Melissa M. Loukas, who taught high school English for nine years. She retired from public education, but because of her love for the students, and the passion she has for English and reading, she decided to open her own business to serve both the people and the things that make her fulfilled.</p>
				<p>EAT offers a variety of services for the serious student looking to improve his English, reading, testing, and studying skills. EAT instills a respect and love for learning within the student, while easing the burden on the parents who may not feel completely prepared to help their children, but who are completely aware of the high stakes environment the world of education has become. Please contact us today, so that your child can excel in his academic world.</p>
				<h2>What Sets Excellence in Academics Tutoring, LLC. Apart from the Others:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Tutoring that is based on educational pedagogy—not educational sound bites—because the owner is a certified teacher.</li>
					<li>Methodologies for student comprehension are based on what works in the classroom. EAT, LLC. is a research driven and student outcome-based company that earns results.</li>
					<li>The owner of Excellence in Academics Tutoring, LLC. is a certified English teacher.  Her certification is maintained, and therefore, so are her trainings in pedagogy and methodology.</li>
					<li>EAT, LLC. maintains close, working relationships with both parents and teachers.  EAT acts as an agent for the student and parent, and as a bridge for the school, where school expectations are met with the help of a teacher who understands what is needed to be academically successful in school.</li>
