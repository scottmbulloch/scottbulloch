          <h1>Praise for Excellence in Academics Tutoring</h1>
          <p>One of the key ways EAT, LLC. ensures student success is by monitoring their learning, while simultaneously working with parents to ascertain the goals set forth by the parents are met.  Here are a couple of letters that speak to that – further reference can be provided, as well.  In addition, to learn more about the owner of EAT, LLC., please visit <a href="http://englishtutorblog.com/">englishtutorblog.com</a> for more information about Ms. Loukas’ worldview regarding education and learning.</p>

          <blockquote>
          To Concerned Parents,
          <br>
          <br>
          With the increased emphasis on standardized testing, parents hire tutors to help their children attain better results. If the child gains lasting knowledge a bonus is attained. This seems backwards but it is the reality of today. If your child is not a standardized test taker, my daughter’s experience would suggest that you should hire Melissa Loukas as his or her tutor. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Melissa was able to quickly assess my daughter’s gaps in knowledge, fill those gaps and wrap together my daughter’s new and previously learned skills into a focused result oriented work program. My daughter’s AIMS results moved to exceeding on both the English and Writing sections thanks to Melissa’s focused assignments and my daughters’ work effort.  
          <br>
          <br>
          Melissa worked her hard but effectively. Melissa’s personality and punitive free style easily evoked a spirit of cooperation.
          <br>
          <br>
          If your child is applying effort, is becoming frustrated and/or is experiencing damage to their self confidence because they are not experiencing results, hire Melissa.  She is a professional who can assess the situation quickly and begin to give your child an efficient learning curriculum that gets results.
          <br>
          <br>
          The skills Melissa helped my daughter attain have been maintained. My daughter has continued to use her focused instruction on college and scholarship application, and again she attained her desired results. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We cannot thank Melissa enough for her effective organization of our daughter’s academic efforts. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Happy Parent

          <blockquote>To Whom It May Concern:
          <br>
          <br>
          It is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I am writing a letter of recommendation for Melissa Loukas.  My initial contact with Melissa was when I hired her to tutor my twelve year old daughter, Lily.  Lily was in need of enrichment in the areas of writing and ready.  Melissa introduced her to the elements of research, writing research papers, tutored her on summarizing, and taking notes on textbooks, and explained  how to make paragraphs with more detail, in addition to helping  her with general homework assignments.
          <br>
          <br>
          During the few months Melissa tutored my daughter, Lily never complained about the additional work Melissa gave her outside of her own school work.  I found this unusual.  I think the reason was that Melissa presented the material with such ease and humor that she set the tone for the tutoring. Her creative ideas for presentations and activities were inventive and seemed to keep my daughter’s interest.
          <br>
          <br>
          All during the months I had Melissa working with my daughter, she distinguished herself as a conscientious and energetic teacher.  I admire her teaching skills.  Should I need to hire a tutor in the future, I would gladly call Melissa again.
          <br>
          <br>
          Sincerely,
          <br>
          <br>
