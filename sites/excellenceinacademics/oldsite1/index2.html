                        <p>Excellence in Academics Tutoring, LLC. (EAT) was founded and is owned by Melissa M. Loukas, who taught high school English for nine years.  She retired from public education, but because of her love for the students, and the passion she has for English and reading, she decided to open her own business to serve both the people and the things that make her fulfilled.</p>

EAT instills a respect and love for learning within the student, while easing the burden on the parents who may not feel completely prepared to help their children, but who are completely aware of the high stakes environment the world of education has become.  Please contact us today, so that your child can excel in his academic world.</p>
