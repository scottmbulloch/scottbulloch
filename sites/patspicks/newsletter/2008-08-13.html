      <div>The 2008 Summer Olympics that began this week in Beijing dominating the media and interoffice water-cooler discussions. The Olympics are always full of drama - whether it's the thrill of the Americans winning a relay race by a fingernail or the scandal of a Chinese child being replaced by a "cuter" version during the opening ceremony - you can't make this stuff up. This is the ultimate form of reality television, without the tackiness of bachelorettes choosing a groom or vice versa.</div>
      <br />
      <div>This year's opening ceremony set a new television viewership record in the United States. In Austin, I'm not sure if it's the extreme summer heat that's causing people to stay glued to their televisions, or if it's all of the hometown athletes we can watch, like swimmers Kristy  Covington, Aaron Peirsol, and Garrett Weber-Gale. In my case, I watch the Olympics because it makes me feel like a kid again.</div>
      <br />
      <div>I've already told my kids how sad it is  that they missed out on the Olympics' "glory years," which to me were the games of 1972 and 1976. That's when I was a kid and the Olympics were new to me. I spent countless hours completely smitten with <a href="http://www.olgakorbut.com">Olga Korbut</a> and <a href="http://www.markspitzusa.com">Mark Spitz</a> in Berlin in 1972. Some people attribute the beginning of the end of the Cold War to America's affection for Olga. But then again, nuclear war seemed awfully close when the United States lost the gold medal basketball game to the U.S.S.R. We were robbed! I screamed a loud curse word for the first time in front of my parents. They were so proud of my patriotism, I suppose, they bragged about it for months. I was 10.</div>
      <br />
      <div>In 1976, I was 14 and couldn't take my eyes off of Bruce Jenner (he still looks good). I will also never forget watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Com%C4%83neci">Nadia Comaneci</a> score one perfect "10" after another in gymnastics in Montreal. Did you know she grew up and married the hunky American gymnast Bart Conner? They now run a <a href="http://www.bartconnergymnastics.com/about/index.html">gymnastics academy</a> in Norman, Oklahoma, and have a 12-year-old son named Dylan. With his genes, surely that child will be impressing us at the London summer Olympics in 2012.</div>
      <br />
      <div>I think the Olympics are a great cultural phenomenon that can bind us as Americans and as people of the world. Call me a nerd, but I almost always get a tear in my eye when the national anthem is played, but I also love it when the underdog from another country wins a medal. Every lesson you need to succeed in life can be learned by watching the Olympics - to be honest, to always try your best, to get up when you fall, to live in the moment, and to give your friends a hand up, a high-five, or a shoulder to cry on. I love the Olympics.</div>

      <div>Austin-area residents have the opportunity to receive a <strong>free memory screening test</strong> with the <a href="http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=8185763&msgid=140478&act=6W98&c=185483&admin=0&destination=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dementiascreening.com%2F">GrayMatters&reg; Assessment System</a> during a special <strong>Alzheimer's Awareness event to be held Thursday, August 21, 2008, at Buckner Villas, a Buckner Retirement Community located at 11110 Tom Adams Drive, Austin, 78753.</strong></div>
      <br />
      <div>Nearly 5.2 million people in the United States are affected by dementia and memory loss, and nearly 10 million baby boomers will be diagnosed in their lifetimes. Early detection can lead to more effective treatment, a longer period of independence and better quality of life.</div>
      <br />
      <div>Speakers at the educational event will include Dr. Samuel Brinkman, neuropsychologist and creator of the GrayMatters&reg; Assessment System; Christian Wells of the Alzheimer's Association - Capitol of Texas Chapter; Dr. Pearl Merritt, president of Buckner Retirement Services Inc.; and Dr. Richard Taylor, psychologist and author of the book <em>Alzheimer's From the Inside Out.</em></div>
      <br />
      <div>Taylor was diagnosed with Alzheimer's-type dementia seven years ago. He often speaks to Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers about what it's like to live with dementia and how friends and family can help. He was recently featured in the <em><a href="http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=8185763&msgid=140478&act=6W98&c=185483&admin=0&destination=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chron.com%2Fdisp%2Fstory.mpl%2Flife%2Fmain%2F5783431.html">Houston Chronicle</a></em>.</div>
      <br />
      <div><strong>The speaker's portion of the program will run from 1:30 to 3:30pm, with screenings offered from  8:30am - 1:30pm and 3:30pm - 4:30pm. To sign up in advance for a free screening appointment, individuals can call 1-800-381-4551 or sign up online at </strong><a href="http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=8185763&msgid=140478&act=6W98&c=185483&admin=0&destination=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bucknerretirement.org%2F"><strong>http://www.bucknerretirement.org</strong></a><strong>. <em>Screenings will be available to drop-ins on a space-available basis only.</em></strong></div>
      <br />
      <div>The GrayMatters&reg; Assessment System provides a quick, accurate, and affordable tool for identifying Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. The simple memory screening test has been incorporated into an easy-to-use, touch-screen computer system. No computer knowledge is  needed to take the test. It can be taken during a doctor's office visit, with results available within minutes for the patient's physician to review.</div>
      <br />
      <div>Although Alzheimer's disease currently has no cure, medications can slow the progress of the disease - and they work best with early treatment.</div>
      <br />
      <div>"In some cases, Alzheimer's-like symptoms might even be caused by a  physical illness or problem that can be treated and even reversed - if detected early," Brinkman said. "Potentially reversible dementias can be caused by such conditions as depression or B-12 deficiency. Effective screening leads to early detection and appropriate treatment."</div>
      <br />
      <div>Brinkman recommends screening on a regular basis before memory and other cognitive problems emerge.</div>
      <br />
      <div>"Most people should have a baseline memory screening test in their 50s or early 60s," Brinkman advises.</div>
      <br />
      <div>Screening is recommended every one to two years for people in their 60s and annually for those ages 70 and older. For people who are at greater  risk (with identifiable risk factors such as a parent diagnosed with Alzheimer's), annual screening should begin earlier.</div>
      <br />
      <div>Buckner Retirement Services strives to enhance the lives of senior adults and their families by promoting an active, healthy lifestyle while maintaining residents' independence and dignity.</div>
