1.) In case you haven't been there, there is only outdoor seating and on Saturday it can be crowded. <br>
2.) Expect a short wait to order and a serious wait (1 hour) for your food on Saturday. Either place your order and run an errand or call your order in (552-9034). Or go on Wed. or Thurs. Dorothy Filley loves the Roasted chicken w/ carmelized onions and goat cheese.<br>
<br>
The yummiest cupcakes are served by <a href="http://www.heycupcake.com/"><strong>Hey Cupcake!</strong></a> on South Congress. My personal favorite is the Red Velvet but lots of folks love the Michael Jackson (chocolate bottom with cream cheese top). Plus you can print a two-for-one coupon on their Web site to try them! </p>
             <p>At the <a href="http://torchystacos.com/"><strong>Torchy's Tacos</strong></a> trailer, Executive Chef Michael Rypka offers tacos such as The Democrat, shredded beef barbacoa and onions topped off with fresh avocado, queso fresco, cilantro and a wedge of lime served on a corn tortilla with green sauce.

An outstanding topper for any grilled chicken or fish fillet.<br>

2 T. finely slivered fresh basil leaves<br>
2 T. olive oil, divided<br>

Preparation:<br>
Heat a large skillet and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the corn and saut&eacute; over medium-high heat for about two minutes, or until corn is just beginning to color. Add in the tomatoes and the scallions, and
                     cook for one minute more. Remove from heat and add the basil, the

Lee Ann Kocurek at <strong>Austin Wine Merchant</strong> recommends a <strong>Cr&eacute;mant de Bourgogne</strong>, the undervalued next door neighbor to the wines of Champagne. And what a difference that short distance makes in the price. A nice <strong>Simonnet-Febvre</strong> (chardonnay &amp; varietals) costs $16.25.<br>
               <br>
</p>
             <p>From Spain there is the popular cava. Try <strong>Ravent&oacute;s</strong> ($19.99), A blend of 60% Macabeo, 20% Xarel-lo and 20% Parellada. Or an Italian Prosecco such as <strong>Loredan Gasparini</strong> ($13.75).  A little more crisp and dry than most proseccos.</p>
             <p>For an American wine, try <strong>Schramsberg Blanc de Noirs</strong>, a vintage sparkler at $29.99.</p>
             <p>And, of course, the rock star of sparkling, Champagne. One of the best known Houses is <strong>Taittinger</strong>. There are many selections, but we picked the La Francaise Brut, NV, at $37.50.</p>
             <p>The small growers are especially interesting because, unlike the large negotiants, they grow their own grapes. Try <strong>Gaston Chiquet Premier Cru</strong> at $45.</p></td>

             <br>
             <em><strong>How to Pick a Peach</strong></em> by Russ Parsons tells you the development of our fruits &amp; vegetables, how to select them and then store &amp; prepare them (&amp; recipes). We found a copy at Book People. Want to keep green beans a vibrant green? Cook in lots of water, return water to boil quickly, cook fast &amp; plunge in cold water. <em><strong>The Produce Bible</strong></em> by Leanne Kitchen also looked promising.<br>
             <br>
             And Michael Chiarello (of Food Network fame) has a blog that discusses fresh produce, including the grapes he grows for wine. <br>

               <br>
               Vinho verde from Portugal is light and has a little sparkle and could be used for spritzers also. Broadbent ($8.75) and Casal Garcia ($6.25) are good ones to try. If you like the Casal Garcia, get a couple of bottles because I checked another store and their supplier is temporarily out of it.</p>
             <p><strong>Sancerre</strong> is always a good choice. Try La Crele 2006 ($22.50). Or a <strong>Muscadet Sevre-et-Maine Sur Lie</strong>&hellip;light &amp; refreshing. Try 2006 Domaine de la Quilla.</p>

<br>
1/2 lb. asparagus spears, cut into 2" lengths<br>

2 T. olive oil<br>
<br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
<br>
2-3 T. crumbled goat cheese or ricotta salata<br>
<br>
<br>
Prepare an outdoor grill to make a hot fire.&nbsp; Toss all ingredients through the salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl.&nbsp; Tear off&nbsp;two 24" sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil; lay foil on flat surface and arrange half the vegetables on half of each piece of foil.&nbsp; For each packet, fold other half of foil over vegetables and crimp edges all the way around to seal completely.&nbsp; Grill the packets on a rack over a hot fire for about 20 minutes, until contents are sizzling and foil has puffed slightly.&nbsp; Transfer packets to a large platter, and then carefully slit them open and pour contents out onto the platter.&nbsp; Sprinkle with the crumbled cheese and serve.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is an easy way to prepare vegetables and a fun alternative to the usual stovetop steaming.&nbsp; Feel free to vary the selection of vegetables, being sure to cut them&nbsp;into appropriately sized chunks (harder vegetables such as carrots should be cut into smaller chunks than softer vegetables such as zucchini, etc.) so that all vegetables finish cooking in the same amount of time.&nbsp; The hot fire of the grill will&nbsp;lightly caramelize the food&nbsp;as it steams inside the foil, intensifying the flavors without subjecting the food to any smoke.</p>
