Actually, yes! A <strong>FREE live outdoor concert!</strong></p>
             <p>This Wednesday (June 11), 107.1 KGSR-FM kicks off its 18th annual Blues on the Green, Austin's largest free concert series. Every other Wednesday through Aug. 20, from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., Zilker Park's Rock Island will host some of Texas' greatest blues artists. This week, Austin's own <strong>Asleep At The Wheel</strong> will be getting things off to a great start. </p>
             <p>In addition to the live entertainment, patrons are invited to satisfy their appetites and quench their thirsts with food and drinks from several of Austin's best restaurants. There will be charity booths to visit as well!</p>
             <p>Be sure to bring sunblock, a blanket, chairs and animals on leashes. As always, glass and alcohol are not allowed in Austin parks. While the concert is free, parking is not. There will be $3 parking available off of Stratford Drive under the Mopac Bridge.</p>
             <p>For more information and to see the line-up for the summer, check the <a href="http://www.kgsr.com/blues/index.html">KGSR website</a></p>

           <td class="textmain"> <p>Now that there are hundreds of millions of online blogs (online web logs, for those of you who've been living in a cave), odds are you know a blogger, you have a friend who's a blogger, or you've got your own blog. However it happened, welcome to the wonderful world of self-publishing &ndash; some of it is truly awful, full of grammatical errors and illogical thought; and some of it as beautifully written and photographed as Pulitzer-Prize winners. </p>
             <p>The first blog I ever read, and still adore, is <strong>In The Pink Texas</strong>, written by Eileen Smith. She's the only blogger I know who has parlayed a blog into a day job. A former legislative staffer, Eileen is now the editor of Texas Monthly's online site, writing a blog for them about this year's presidential race called Poll Dancing. She's wickedly funny, and her cadre of commenters is hilarious too.</p>
             <p>In most cases, comments make the blog better than it would be just by itself. It proves what good taste fellow fans of a blog have. <strong>Pat's Picks' blog</strong>, hosted on Blogger (a Google product) is set up so that Pat can read a comment before posting it. If means there will be a delay between when you comment and when the rest of the world can see it (Pat has a real job on the side, you know), but it's the best way to ensure her blog doesn't get hijacked by someone with a dirty mouth.</p>
             <p>Another blog that I've found rises above the mainstream is <strong>Dooce</strong> by Heather B. Armstrong. She actually lost a job because of blogging, but now supports her family through it (she has a gazillion readers who buy her t-shirts, calendars, books, and click on the online ads). Frequently profane (be warned!), she talks about the joys and disappointments of everyday life. She also posts fabulous photos of her dogs and her child (I actually heard about Dooce from Eileen). Not for the timid, but always entertaining.</p>
             <p><strong>ThePioneerWoman</strong> is a former city girl now living on a ranch in Oklahoma. Like Dooce, she takes beautiful photos of her children and her dogs (and the cattle). She also has recipes! It's a nice way to live vicariously through someone else.</p>
             <p>If you're looking for a woman who's blogging about any topic on earth, you should go to <strong>Blogher</strong> and search their directory. </p>
             <p>And if you'd like to keep up with what the entire Blogosphere is saying on any subject, I highly recommend setting up your own Bloglines account. It allows you to search for blogs using keywords you're interested in (a city, a person, a sport, etc.) and then when you find a blog you like, you can subscribe to it and organize the blogs by subject matter (look for the "Easy Subscribe Bookmarklet" on the left-hand side and follow the simple directions). Then, instead of spending half your life reading random blogs, you subscribe to the ones you know are good, and then just go directly to your Bloglines folders. It's like having your own personal assistant who files reading material for you.</p>
             <p>Reading blogs can be the biggest waste of time, or the greatest joy, if you find one you can relate to. There's a blog out there for everyone. And if there's not&hellip; start writing one!</p>
