          <td colspan="2" class="white">Hi, I'm Fred. I was born in Wilmington, Delaware a 

            long, long time ago. I lived my early days in Chicago and Springfield, 

            Illinois before moving to Scottsdale in 1964. I went to Scottsdale 

            High, and immediately fell in love with Arizona like everyone else. 

            In 1967, I joined the Marine Corps and proudly served 2 tours of duty 

            in Vietnam, just south of DaNang at Marble Mountain. I made it home 

            and found a variety of jobs to keep me happy. I have been very fortunate 

            in always finding things that are interesting and enjoyable to me. 

            Managing a sailboat shop and racing sailboats professionally for 6 

            years was one of them. I believe having fun and enjoying what you 

            do is critical.<br> <br>
            
            I got into the furniture business in the 

            late 80's, working for a company in the Scottsdale airpark. I started 

            my own furniture store as well, but found that I enjoy being on my 

            own and helping designers with final touches (hanging art, mirrors, 

            etc.). I love transporting things around the country for people and 

            making them smile with my service.<br> <br>

            My hobbies: avid motorcyclist, racquetball, sailing, cooking and being at home with 

            my kids Daisy and Amy, Arf Arf!</td>
