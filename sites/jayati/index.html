			<p>Come and join Jayati Yoga &amp; Fitness every Sunday morning for workouts that will transform the way you feel about yourself and your exercise routine. The plan is simple &mdash; switch it up every week and keep it fun! One of the biggest roadblocks that everyone runs into when it comes to fitness is that it becomes repetitive and dull, so each Sunday, I will take you through a new routine that will challenge your mind and your body. The current class offering will be every Sunday at 10:30am for approximately 75 minutes. Although the classes are quite challenging, they are intended for people at all levels of fitness. I always encourage students to do the best they can with the skills they have and to never feel intimidated. The classes will rotate each week but the sequencing of each class will always be similar allowing students to build on their skills. Rotating class schedule will include: Vinyasa Pilates&trade;, Plyometrics &amp; Abs, Power Vinyasa Yoga, Flow Yoga &amp; Pilates, and The Circuit.</p>
