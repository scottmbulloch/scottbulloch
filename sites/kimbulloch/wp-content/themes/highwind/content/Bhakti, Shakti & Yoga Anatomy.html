<h3>Core Strength Vinyasa Immersion <small>- The 7 Core Cues</small></h3>
<p>Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga founder and creator, <a href="http://sadienardini.com">Sadie Nardini</a>, considers CSV a "perspective" on all yoga, rather than just its own style.  The principles of CSV can be added to any style of yoga to help bring students into more "core" generated alignment, truly honoring the concept of sthira/sukha within each asana.  The 7 Core Cues of CSV are sequential steps, always taught in order, that empower students through their transitions and into each asana with optimized alignment, strength, and use of the body in a much more holistic way.</p>

<div class="show-more-content">
 
<p>The 7 Core Cues are based on the understanding of myofascial meridians (the fact that your muscles run in holistic, whole-body lines, not singular muscles as many people think), and unique bone and joint alignment where EVERY student is different.  We believe that 90% of any yoga pose should be aligned BEFORE you get into the pose, not after you're already there.  The 7 Core Cues expand on the concept of building each asana from foundation, to core, to expression and give more focus to a crucial new world of internal vs. external yoga cueing and aligning your students properly through the transitions.</p>
<p>Yoga teachers: Learning this information will light up your students in ways they have never experienced, and keep them coming back to your classes.  It will also help you have a road map to safer instructing, every time.  CSV will compliment your existing style, no matter what it is, so you don't have to give it up&mdash;we will just help you shore it up, to make your style much more effective, dynamic and safe!</p>
<p>If you're a yoga student wanting to learn how to ensure your yoga practice is giving you all the benefits, with way less chance of injury, this training is also for YOU!</p>
<p>In this immersion you will learn:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 Core Qualities of CSV: Contraction vs. Expansion Energy</li>
  <li>3 Core Elements to building every pose:   Foundation, Core, Expression</li>
  <li>7 Core Cues:  A further breakdown of 3 Core Elements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bhakti Yoga Immersion <small>- The Yoga of Devotion</small></h3>
<p>Bhakti Yoga is the yoga of devotion.  Bhakti is not mere emotionalism, it's challenge lies in the consistent practice of unconditional love-  for others, all living beings, our community and ourselves.  Bhakti Yoga actually engages rigorous tapas of the Mind and Spirit as we make the shift from fear to love, from head to heart.  The Bhakti Yoga practices that facilitate this shift include chanting, puja, pranayama, meditation and asana practices, all transformed into offerings to, and communion with, the Divine and each other.  The Bhakta seeks to dissolve the ego in order to be a transparency for God , and a servant to her/his fellows.</p>

<div class="show-more-content">

<p>In this Immersion we will chant mantra:</p>
<blockquote>
A mantra can be thought of as a sonic embodiment of the supreme being who, through grace, takes infinite recognizable forms.
<cite>- Jai Uttal</cite>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>The meanings of each mantra.  We'll find out about the deities, who each  represent and amplify various positive qualities, such as love, courage,  compassion, strength, abundance, etc.</li>
  <li>Ideas on developing a personal practice, identifying our Ishta devata, and  situational applications.</li>
  <li>We will learn the difference between kirtan style chant and Vedic chant.</li>
  <li>We will work with the bija mantras for each chakra.</li>
  <li>The power of the Sanskrit language</li>
  <li>If you play an instrument, or even have some percussion items, bring them!</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll practice Bhakti Vinyasa and look at how we may apply Bhakti Yoga in our asana practice.</p>
<p>In the words of Sri BKS Iyengar</p>
<blockquote>
The body is my temple, asanas are my  prayers.
</blockquote>
<p>We'll also observe Hanuman Puja, a ceremony that brings the qualities of Sri Hanuman, the ultimate Bhakti Yogi, into our beings and environment.  These qualities include love, service, devotion, courage, an impeccable sense of timing, a delightful sense of humor, an ability to respond correctly and immediately to any situation, power to sustain our Dharma, our life's purpose, to name a few...</p>
