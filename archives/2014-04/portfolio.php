                  <p>Pearson is a large education company and my full time employer for close to four years. I was hired and worked primarily as a web designer but also used in numerous capacities during my tenure.</p>
                  <p>My group functioned as an in house creative agency developing online marketing campaign materials. I had a great experience there and learned a lot about working with not only many people, but many different groups in the company all over the globe. It was a difficult decision to leave, but eventually my duties changed enough that I needed to get back to what I love and continue web development.</p>
                  <p>My job was mainly focused in these areas:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Front end development for microsites, landing pages, forms and routine maintenance</li>
                    <li>Email coding and deployment</li>
                    <li>Developing coding best practices for other groups</li>
                    <li>Analytics integration and reporting</li>
                    <li>Database analysis</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Pearson has many web properties which I have worked on but my responsibilities were usually delegated to <a href="http://www.pearsonschool.com/">pearsonschool.com</a> and <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/">pearsonhighered.com</a>.</p>
