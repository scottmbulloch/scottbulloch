                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>I have studied computer science but have a degree in design. I love the web because it a place where art and programming meet. My passion is finding ways to make the web a better place through code and an eye for detail. There is always something new to learn and building web applications is never boring.</p>
                <p>A large focus of mine is responsive design and user experience. I am obessive about pixel precision and coding standards but also I enjoy breaking the boundaries of expectation and trying new things.</p>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <h4>Things I know by heart</h4>
                <p>
                  <strong>HTML and CSS.</strong> Using a variety of templating languages, pre- and post-processors, build tools and ingenuity I can crank out a top notch UI for any kind of web app.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>JavaScript.</strong> JS has come a long way since my early days hacking together plugins for MooTools and Prototype. I have used jQuery daily for over a decade but the last few years most of my time has been spent in Angular and React. I can regularly be seen making asynchronous calls to web services, operating on JSON data, manipulating the DOM and writing unit tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Documentation.</strong> Communication is extremely important in software development. Nothing can built alone and great documentation saves time and frustration when collaborating with others. I take care in providing clear and concise information about my code from comments in source, to wikis and training materials.
                </p>
                <h4>Things I know well</h4>
                <p>
                  <strong>Git.</strong> Another everyday tool and essential for keeping sanity when collaborating on code. The only reason I would say I don't know this by heart is because I hanve't mastered the command line yet. I am also familiar with Subversion but for most companies repositories in GitHub and BitBucket make more sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>PHP and MySQL.</strong> I have built a lot of WordPress sites which is where most of this experience comes from, although I also have some time with SQL when I was running email marketing campaigns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Photoshop, Sketch and Illustrator.</strong> I used to spend nearly every day with Photoshop or Illustrator open next to my text editor. These days it's not as necessary but I still enjoy working with graphics. Back in my early days I was doing freelance graphic design along with web development for small businesses that needed complete branding from a logo to website.
