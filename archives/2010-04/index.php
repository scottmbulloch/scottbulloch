					<h2>December 20, 2009</h2>
					<p>It seems I use JavaScript more and more every day, and I love it as a programming language. A JS based server sounded like a bad ass idea to me, and I found several including <a href="http://www.jaxer.org/" title="Aptana Jaxer">Jaxer, an AJAX web server</a>.</p>

					<p>Since HTML5 has really come into focus this year [many developers have full HTML5 websites up &amp; running now], I have been checking in every month looking for new information on HTML5 and how it's progressing. It will be awhile before browser support is comprehensive enough for most designers &amp; developers to use HTML5, but I am anxious for that day to come. If you haven't heard anything about HTML5 yet, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/16/html5-and-the-future-of-the-web/" title="HTML5 and the Future of the Web">here is a good article</a> from Smashing Magazine to get you started.</p>
					<h2>October 21, 2009</h2>
					<p>The first annual <a href="http://phxdw.com/index.php" title="Phoenix Design Week">Phoenix Design Week</a> is upon us! Please attend and support the Phoenix design community. There are many great things for anyone involved in graphic design, web development, marketing, and visual arts.</p>

					<p>Another website completed! I had a lot of fun with this one. It is a site for my friends Keith &amp; Jillian Jackson's haunted house. <a href="http://www.jackandjillshauntedhill.com/" title="Jack And Jill's Haunted Hill">Visit site here</a>.</p>
					<h2>August 31, 2009</h2>
					<p>I finished my wife Kim's website. She teaches yoga and pilates classes around Phoenix. <a href="http://www.jayatiyogaandfitness.com/" title="Jayati Yoga And Fitness">Check out the website here</a>.</p>
					<h2>July 8, 2009</h2>
					<p>I started a contract with Pearson Education for a least the next 5 months. I am helping code and deploy email campaigns as well as developing new web pages for the Pearson Education website <a href="http://www.pearsonschool.com/" title="Pearson">pearsonschool.com</a>.</p>
