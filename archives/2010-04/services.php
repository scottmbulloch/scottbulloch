					<h2>Web Development</h2>
                    <p>Although I am formally trained as a designer for printed materials, most of my work in recent years has been for the web. I started school as a programmer, but wanted to switch to something more creative minded. Making websites is the perfect combination of left and right brain thinking, it utilizes my desire to create and my technical skills. I have continued to educate myself in most current technologies and web standards to provide the best online solutions for my clients. My capabilties for web design are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>XHTML And CSS Valid Websites</li>
						<li>PHP And MySQL Websites</li>
						<li>Interactive JavaScript</li>
						<li>Flash Websites</li>
						<li>Updates</li>
						<li>Redesigns</li>
						<li>Widgets &amp; Banners</li>
						<li>Web Forms</li>
						<li>Content Management Systems [CMS]</li>
						<li>eCommerce And Paypal Integration</li>
						<li>Blogs</li>
						<li>Social Network Profiles</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Graphic Design</h2>
					<p>I started my professional life designing for printed materials, and it continues to be a passion of mine. I have designed for a variety of different projects over the years, and it is both fun and challenging to create a quality product. Many details have to be taken into consideration before something is printed to be assured it retains the integrity of the original vision for the project. I love the look, feel and smell of something hot off the press. My experience as a graphic designer includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Logos</li>
						<li>Business Cards</li>
						<li>Identity Suites</li>
						<li>Advertisements</li>
						<li>Brochures</li>
						<li>Postcard Mailers/Invitations</li>
						<li>Event Posters</li>
						<li>Magazines</li>
						<li>Newsletters</li>
						<li>T-shirts</li>
						<li>Product Packaging</li>
					</ul>
