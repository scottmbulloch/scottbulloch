					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>My name is Scott Bulloch and I am a freelance graphic designer located in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
					<p>I believe in the language of visual communication and how it binds the world together. Design is everywhere and whether we realize it or not, it affects our perception and judgement every day. A well planned design is more than just a marketing tool, it is an integral part of building a business. A good design provides information, direction, recognition, emotion, familiarity, and literally changes the way we view the world around us. The designs implemented for your company are the face that the world looks at when deciding what to think and believe.</p>
					<p>Shouldn't something this important be in the hands of someone you trust? My number one priority is client satisfaction, and I don't stop working until all of my clients' needs are met 100 percent.</p>
