        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="article">
          <p>If you have wandered onto this page it is probably because you have some interest in me and my career. I am a professional graphic designer and web developer currently living in Phoenix, Arizona. My full time gig is working for Pearson Education in the marketing department, coding emails and building informative landing environments within the framework of <a href="www.pearsonschool.com">pearsonschool.com</a>. My professional life goes beyond the corporate world and I spend my free time testing new ideas, expanding my knowledge and excercising my creativity by building websites for my friends and family.</p>
          <p>I believe in the language of visual communication and how it binds the world together. Design is everywhere and it affects our perception and judgement on a daily basis. A well planned design is more than just a marketing tool, it is an integral part of building a business, a brand and an identity. Good design communicates information, recognition, emotion, and attachment. The designs implemented for your company are the face that the world looks at when deciding what to think and believe. My strength and weakness both lie in my attention to detail and relentless pursuite of perfection. I am always striving to be better and continue to evolve with the ever changing landscape of technology.</p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>Although formally trained as a designer, I consider myself a developer and most of my work has been on the web. I started school as a programmer, but wanted to switch to something more creative minded. Making websites is the perfect combination of left and right brain thinking, it utilizes my desire to create and my technical skills. I have continued to educate myself in most current technologies and web standards to provide the best online solutions for my clients.</p>

            <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
            <p>I started my professional life designing for printed materials, and it continues to be a passion of mine. I have designed for a variety of different projects over the years, and it is both fun and challenging to create a quality product. Many details have to be taken into consideration before something is printed to be assured it retains the integrity of the original vision for the project. I love the look, feel and smell of something hot off the press.</p>
