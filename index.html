                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>I have studied computer science but have a degree in design. I love the web because it a place where art and programming meet. My passion is finding ways to make the web a better place through code and an eye for detail. There is always something new to learn and being a web developer never gets old.</p>
                <p>A large focus of mine is responsive design and user experience. I am obessive about precision proper execution but I enjoy breaking the boundaries of expectation and trying new things.</p>

                <h4>Things I know by heart</h4>
                <p>
                  <strong>HTML and CSS.</strong> Using a variety of templating languages, pre- and post-processors, build tools and ingenuity I can crank out a top notch UI for any kind of web app.
                </p>
                <h4>Things I know well</h4>
                <p>
                  <strong>JavaScript.</strong> JS has come a long way since my early days hacking together plugins for MooTools and Prototype. I have used jQuery daily for a while now but more recently I am gaining proficiency in frameworks like Angular 2. I am used to asynchronous calls to web services, operating on JSON data, manipulating the DOM and have built small applications myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Git.</strong> Another everyday tool and essential for keeping sanity when collaborating on code. The only reason I would say I don' tknow this by heart is because I hanve't mastered the command line yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>PHP and MySQL.</strong> I have built a lot of WordPress sites which is where most of this experience comes from.
